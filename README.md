# Stochastic_Modelling
Stochastic modeling with MATLAB, especially in the context of financial applications like the Black-Scholes model, is a powerful way to analyze and simulate the behavior of financial instruments under uncertainty. Below, we'll go through the essentials of using MATLAB for stochastic modeling and specifically for the Black-Scholes model.
